Airsoft m4 magazine, rubber band version

My goal was to make a small magazine at a low cost. So rather than having one big magazine at the airsoft field. I could have many small ones and make the game more realistic.

The first video at the bottom of the page shows the operation of the magazine. 
The second video shows how to assemble the magazine.

### Features:

- Capacity 40 BBs 

- Durable design

- Lightweight at 60g

- Low cost per magazine

- An indicator shows when the magazine is full

### Requirements:

- Rubber band (20cm in length)

- Pencil spring (4mm in diameter, 15mm or 20mm in length) 

- 5 drywall nails (1.5mm in diameter, 12mm in length, nail head is less than 4mm in diameter).

- Print 3 rubber band pulleys and print other stl-files once.

- Parts are best to be printed in the same orientation as shown in the picture


### Other notes:

- You can buy rubber bands, pencil springs and nails in bulk from aliexpress.

- infill at 10 %

- No rafts or support material is needed.

- Any hard filament material will work, like PLA.

- Layer height at 0.15 mm has worked for me. 

- If the rubber band is very stiff, you won't be able to load the magazine fully.
