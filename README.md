Airsoft m4 magazine, rubber band version

My goal was to make a small magazine at a low cost. So rather than having one big magazine at the airsoft field. I could have many small ones and make the game more realistic.

### Features:

- Capacity 40 BBs 

- Durable design

- Lightweight at 60g

- Low cost per magazine

- An indicator shows when the magazine is full

### Requirements:

- Rubber band (20cm in length)

- Pencil spring (4mm in diameter, 15mm or 20mm in length) 

- 5 drywall nails (1.5mm in diameter, 12mm in length, nail head is less than 4mm in diameter).

- Print 3 rubber band pulleys and print other stl-files once.

- Parts are best to be printed in the same orientation as shown in the picture


### Other notes:

- You can buy rubber bands, pencil springs and nails in bulk from aliexpress.

- infill at 10 %

- No rafts or support material is needed.

- Any hard filament material will work, like PLA.

- Layer height at 0.15 mm has worked for me. 

- If the rubber band is very stiff, you won't be able to load the magazine fully.
